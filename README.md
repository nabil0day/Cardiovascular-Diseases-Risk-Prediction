# Cardiovascular-Diseases-Risk-Prediction
## Dataset Details
The cardiovascular disease risk prediction dataset derived from the CDC's (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) in 2021 encompasses various attributes related to health indicators and behaviors. This dataset was collected from Kaggle. This cardiovascular disease risk prediction dataset contains 308854 samples. Additionally, it contains 19 attributes including the target attribute. Also here, 7 are numerical and 12 are categorical attributes.

## Project Overview

This project applies Pearson's chi-squared test to identify significant attributes within a dataset. It then utilizes the Naive Bayes Classifier to predict accuracy. The project employs two distinct approaches to report accuracy:

## Dataset Division

The dataset is split into training and test sets to assess classifier accuracy.

## 10-Fold Cross-Validation

Utilizes a 10-fold cross-validation method to robustly evaluate classifier performance.

The project generates a confusion matrix and reports Recall, Precision, and F-Measure to assess classifier effectiveness and performance.
